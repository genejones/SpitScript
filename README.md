# SpitScript
A rap vocabulary that transpiles to JavaScript.

## Introduction
We've all been there: it's Christmas dinner, the family is around a table piled high with celebratory dishes, and you're all having a good time. Then cousin Ernie asks about your plans for the next few years. Caught off guard, you fail to invent a suitable lie and instead mutter something about becoming a computer programmer.

The table goes silent. Everyone exchanges exasperated glances. Aunt Bertha pauses mid-chew and a glob of mashed potatoes falls from the corner of her mouth.

Grandma Janey tries to calm everyone down. "Now, now," she says. "He's still young." Then she turns to you. "Don't you think you should consider something more practical, like becoming a platinum rapper?"

Dad rubs his forehead with a tired hand. "We raised you with plenty of good role models," he says. "Drake, Cudi, Ye. What's wrong with them? Don't you want to be a provider, make a difference?"

You're holding back tears now. "I don't want to be a rapper," you say, but you know your protest will fall on deaf ears. "I don't care about rap music."

Someone gasps. Maybe everyone. "But dear," mother says kindly. "You're so *good* at rapping. Why, you've been spitting dope bars since you were hardly three years old. Just the other day I was talking to Great-Aunt Charlie about how ill your flow is."

You push yourself away from the table. "Excuse me," you say. "I'm not hungry any more." You tear yourself away from a sea of staring eyes and run to the bathroom.

It would be so easy to give up on your dreams, sign a record deal and spend the rest of your life in the studio, dropping truth. But something inside of you says *no*. You were meant to be a programmer.

Well, **SpitScript is here for you.**

## What is SpitScript?
SpitScript is a transpiler. It transforms a special set of words common in rap music to JavaScript. Its lexical structure is identical to JavaScript and it's easy to learn.

## What is the purpose of SpitScript?
SpitScript allows you to write JavaScript that looks like rap lyrics. Finally, you can code to your heart's content regardless of the location -- everyone will think you're just writing a slightly incoherent rap song.

For example, the following SpitScript program prints the first ten Fibonacci numbers to the console:

```
big pusher
lil bruh be hot, got lotta that stuff

bruh he with nothin, yeah be nothin
bruh he with the cool one, yeah be the fool one

rollin these pusher be two uh pusher, under 10 uh pusher got bigger bigger well then

bruh he with the pusher, yeah be bruh with the pusher, he smaller than two yeah bigger than bruh with the pusher, smaller than one, yeah

console get log got this bruh with the pusher, yeah well
okay
```

## How can I learn SpitScript?
A tutorial is coming. In the meantime, check out `parser.js` to get a basic idea of what words are useful in the language.

All symbols are ignored; numbers and unrecognized words are transcribed literally into the resulting syntax; and plenty of ignored words are provided in order for you to form grammatically complete (or incomplete) rap lyrics.

## How did this project come about?
I was bored. I'm a programmer by profession but I enjoy listening to and writing rap music -- this is the collision of those things in my mind.
